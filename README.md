## Project Origin

This project is an evolution of the [Payment Gateway Frontend](https://github.com/devfullcycle/imersao22/tree/main/next-frontend) developed during the Full Stack & Full Cycle Immersion course. 

This project was created for educational purposes to:
- Deepen my understanding of Next.js and modern React patterns
- Explore and implement best practices in frontend development
- Experiment with different architectural patterns
- Add new features and improvements
- Create a more production-ready version

This is a personal learning journey to enhance my skills in frontend development, user experience, and modern web technologies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Node.js | 18+ | Runtime Environment |
| Docker | Latest | Containerization |
| Docker Compose | Latest | Service Orchestration |
| FC Pay Gateway | Running | API & Transaction Processing |
| FC Pay Antifraud | Running | Fraud Detection |

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brunownk/fc-pay-web.git
   cd fc-pay-web
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # The default environment variables are already configured for Docker
   ```

3. **Verify Required Services**

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Both Gateway and Antifraud services must be running and healthy before starting the Web interface.
   > The Web interface depends on APIs and Kafka topics from both services.

   ```bash
   # Check Gateway health
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   # Expected: {"status":"ok"}

   # Check Antifraud health
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   # Expected: {"status":"ok"}
   ```

4. **Start the service**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Verify service health**
   ```bash
   # Check container status
   docker-compose ps
   # Expected: fc-pay-web-app-1 ... (healthy)

   # Check service logs
   docker-compose logs -f app
   # Look for: "Server started" and "Connected to API"

   # Access the web interface
   open http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Features

The Web interface provides:
- Transaction dashboard
- Real-time transaction monitoring
- Fraud detection status
- Account management
- Transaction history
- Analytics and reporting

### Development

For local development:

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start in development mode**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

### Troubleshooting

1. **API Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check Gateway API
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   
   # Check Antifraud API
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   ```

2. **Common Error Messages**

   - "Error: Cannot connect to Gateway API"
     - Verify Gateway service is running
     - Check network connectivity
     - Ensure environment variables are correct

   - "Error: Cannot connect to Antifraud API"
     - Verify Antifraud service is running
     - Check network connectivity
     - Ensure environment variables are correct

   - "Error: Authentication failed"
     - Check API credentials in .env file
     - Verify token expiration
     - Clear browser cache and cookies

3. **UI Issues**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify all required environment variables are set
   - Check browser compatibility (latest Chrome/Firefox/Safari recommended)

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| PORT | Service port | 3000 |
| GATEWAY_API_URL | Gateway service URL | http://localhost:8080 |
| ANTIFRAUD_API_URL | Antifraud service URL | http://localhost:3001 |
| NODE_ENV | Environment mode | development |

### Browser Support

The web interface is tested and supported on:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

### Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**
   - Uses JWT tokens for API authentication
   - Implements session management
   - Supports role-based access control

2. **Data Protection**
   - All API calls use HTTPS in production
   - Sensitive data is never stored in local storage
   - Automatic session timeout

3. **Best Practices**
   - Regular security updates
   - Input validation
   - XSS protection
   - CSRF protection
